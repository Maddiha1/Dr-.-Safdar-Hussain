            The metaverse is swiftly flattering an important player in the e-commerce domain. It provides innumerable opportunities and indicates a revolutionary paradigm shift in e-commerce. Online businesses can now create virtual storefronts that enable immersive, lifelike product exploration within the metaverse, in contrast to traditional brick-and-mortar stores that cater to local customers. Current research offers a novel conceptual framework based on theories of interactive media effects and the stimulusâ€“organismâ€“response paradigm to understand consumer purchase intentions in the metaverse.

           This research examines dryland agriculture's technical efficiency among groundnut farmers in Chakwal Tehsil. Groundnut cultivation is crucial for food security in arid regions. The study analyzes current technical efficiency and ways to optimize resource use. Results show many farmers can increase output by 51% with better input combinations. Technical efficiency scores range from 2% to 99%, indicating diverse practices. Tailored approaches like extension services and plot demos are essential for improvement. The study relates findings to sustainable agriculture and rural development. Enhanced technical efficiency benefits farms, the environment, and the economy.

          Analyzing the efficiency of the water, energy, and food (WEF) nexus is critical for effective governance strategies. Therefore, three-stage data envelopment analysis (DEA) was used to measure the efficiency level of WEF in the 36 districts of Punjab, Pakistan, for the period from 2015 to 2021. Furthermore, the stochastic frontier was used to analyze the effect of external environmental factors on these efficiency scores of the WEF nexus. The results of the DEA showed that the number of frontier efficiency districts decreased, and most districts experienced rank change over time. Overall, the performance of 50% of the districts declined over time.

The findings indicate that servant leadership significantly impacts employeesâ€™ life satisfaction.

      The restoration of the ancient Silk Road intends to reconnect China with Africa, the Middle East, and Europe through a railway network, airports, roads, seaports, and an optical fiber system. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has three components. One Belt, One Road (OBOR) is based upon two parts of the BRI; the maritime Silk Road and the Silk Road economic belt. OBOR is based upon six economic corridors. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is the smartest corridor under OBOR, which passes only through Pakistan, and after completion, will provide a safe and cheap route for China to import oil and energy.

     This research is among the very few studies seeking a focalized examination on the relationship between knowledge sharing within a firm and organizational innovation. This specific study establishes that the knowledge sharing and innovation processes in Islamic banks are integral parts of the survival and progress of business organizations. Knowledge sharing and creativity are essential elements in the development of innovative strategies, but few studies have sought to investigate this relationship. This study proposes a framework with five hypotheses, which predicts the influences of knowledge sharing and organizational innovation on the Pakistani banking sector.

    Agreed on the current attractiveness of microcredit schemes as a means of poverty alleviation, their accessibility to the poor households is of obvious concern. This research article examines the factors influencing the accessibility of microcredit by rural households in Pakistan. An empirical analysis utilizes logit model, with empirical data collected through interviewing 600 households, including both non-borrower and borrower households, a survey conducted between January 2017 and March 2017 in Punjab Province of Pakistan. A total of 13 household-level factors are defined as the determinant of householdsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ access to microcredit, including household size, income, education level and others.

   This study proposed electronic Word Of Mouth (eWOM) conceptual framework for food products information adoption on the internet. Literature review reveals some streams that affect in eWOM involvement such as reviews, reviewers, websites, online opinion seeking, source credibility and their effects on the process of decision-making in the food industry. The results revealed that there was positive influence of reading some reviews because of product popularity, consistency, regency, usefulness rating of reviewers, and websiteâ€™s reliability before information adoption on the internet.

  This study examined the relations between source credibility of eWOM (electronic word of mouth), perceived risk and food products customer's information adoption mediated by argument quality and information usefulness. eWOM has been commonly used to refer the customers during decision-making process for food commodities. Based on this study, we used Elaboration Likelihood Model of information adoption presented by Sussman and Siegal (2003) to check the willingness to buy.

  Increasing consumer motivation to pursue online reviews and information has recently become a potential area of study. Perusing the literature reviews, it is fairly evident that disseminating information largely depends on the innovativeness and the interpretative caliber of writers. Individuals that are involved in electronic word of mouth communication may have high ambitions to realize the needs and requirements of the online community.
